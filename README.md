# AI-ML-Game-Agent
Developed a hybrid AI pipeline combining CNN-based visual perception with A star search for autonomous decision-making in dynamic environments. Achieved 98.67% classification accuracy across 21 classes using PyTorch with data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning, and implemented custom heuristics for efficient real-time pathfinding.
